                    hi !! i hope you enjoyed browsing through this hehehee. ive been wanting to do this for you for so long, but i always slacked off and did something else. but now that were married, theres no room for slacking when it comes to you. there are no shortcuts when it comes to you. there is no easy way out when it comes to you. why is that? because you do the same for me continuously, every single day. youve shown and taught me what it means to love and appreciate. youve taught me how to put in the work for someone you love. you’ve taught me how to go beyond expectations to show someone their value. you’ve taught me a lot. even if it’s about birkins and kellys or amina muaddis. what you love, i love. <br> <br>
                    
                    i wanted to also write a letter to you because i always enjoyed this tradition. and this time im doing this online since youre bad at keeping the letters safe and in one place. so this will forever be saved, dont worry. power of internet <br><br>
                    
                    some cringe stuff generated by an AI when i gave it a prompt about who im writing this for (technically written by me bc i fed it minute details about you and my love for you): 
                <ul>
                   <li> you have turned my life into a life which i can never forget you for. with all your love and understanding, you are a guiding light of happiness and strength through my hard times. on this special day i want to celebrate your birthday as i celebrate your beautiful existence in my life. may God bless you with a happy birthday!</li>
                   <li>  you are the embodiment of all that is good in me. i am so lucky to have you by my side as a wife, a friend and as a mother (idk where tf it got mother from). happy birthday!</li>
                    <li> im thankful that god sent me you. happy birthday to the woman i love and appreciate more than you could ever know.</li>
                    <li>  i want you to know how badly i love you. you are a wonderful person and as long as i am alive, i will always be by your side. its easy to say that you are my best friend but it is more true than any word anyone can think of. happy birthday !</li>
                </ul>
                <br><br>
                these were all generated by an AI BUT dont forget, i tell the AI who it is for, what that person like, what do they mean to me, and much more!!!!! dont discredit me 🤬

                <i><b>something serious:</b></i><br><br>
                
                i know that weve been through some unimaginable hurdles. weve seen insane heights of pain and frustrations. weve suffered. a lot. i know and understand where you come from. the young mahwish, who gave me her all. the one to trust me with everything, eyes closed. i see it. i see the pain that was collected over time. i see the fragility. of you. of the relationship. i see you being fine with being broken into infinite pieces. i see you being brave through it all. i see you. giving. loving. and hurting. 
                
                i can always try to understand what it mustve been like, but ill never truly feel and grasp the intensity of it all. so i thought and thought and read and read into shayari and i think one of my favorite shayari by Faiz Ahmed Faiz covers it well. this is from your perspective.

                Mujh se pehli si muhabbat 
                Mere mehboob na maang
                <br>
                dont ask me to
                Love you as I loved you before
                <br><br>
                
                Maine samjha tha ke tu hai to darakhshaan hai hayaat Tera gham hai to gham-e dahr ka jhagda kya hai
                <br>
                i assumed that as long as I have You, life is radiantbrightshinning what anguish in the world could possibly rival the anguish of being without you
                
                <br><br>
                Teri soorat se hai aalam mein bahaaron ko sabaat<br>
                Teri aankhon ke siva duniya mein rakkha kya hai<br>
                Teri aankhon ke siva duniya mein rakkha kya hai<br>
                Tu jo mil jaaye to taqdeer nigoon ho jaaye<br>
                Yoon na tha main ne faqat chaaha tha yoon ho jaaye
                <br><br>
                Your face is what gives permanence to springtime in this world
                theres nothing in the world other than the beauty of your eyes
                theres nothing in the world other than the beauty of your eyes
                if im able to gain You, destiny would bow down before me
                it wasnt that i wanted it to be like this
                
                
                <br><br>
                if you ever need an entire version of this poem that's sadder and more intense: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BnXfMrBygc&ab_channel=UrduStudio" target="_blank" style="font-family: 'Noto Serif', serif !important;font-size: 20px !important;"> <u>tap here</u></a>

                sometimes when i see you shy away. love me differently. i fail to see you in the context. i fail to see the new way of love you give. this is how to i try to understand and see your love now. i see that you’ve given me your all. all this time, you really did. after being broken (not just by me but others as well), it would truly be unfair of me to ask you to love me the same way. to give me your all blindly again. because you’ve given that already. what there is left? humans adjust and adapt to new environments, even it’s about love. and i see you already doing that in the most beautiful and perfect way. i see your efforts. i see your love. i see you. and i love that so deeply and truly. i love you deeply and truly! there’s no measuring of that. 
                <br><br>
                
                <i><b>to the new love:</b></i><br><br>
                i will go above and beyond to love you. appreciate you. respect you. honor you. have fun with you. work out with you. go to coffee shops with you. go to nice dinners with you. buy you flowers. maaaaaaaaaaybe (likely not) not annoy you for the goody goody all the time. go on adventures with you. take care of you. make you cozy. crack your thumb only when you ask me to. not be super aggressive with you since you’re sensitive and it can hurt. drive you to the beaches. take you snowboarding. i promise to always try. all of this with inshaAllah!!
                
                my Allah give me the ability and strength to understand and fulfill all my responsibilities to you. may Allah keep our relationship healthy, joyful, respectful and thriving. may Allah grant you endless success and happiness. may Allah shower you with blessings. 
                <br><br>
                <b>may Allah always keep us together ❤️ i love you</b>
